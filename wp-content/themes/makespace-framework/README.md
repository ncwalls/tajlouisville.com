# Makespace Framework Theme
The Makespace Framework Theme is the foundation of all Makespace custom websites and should be used in conjunction with the [Makespace Child Theme](https://github.com/makespaceweb/makespace-child). It is primarily a collection of functions and optimizations, and does not ship with any styles, JavaScript, or stand-alone design.

## How To Use

* If using the [Makespace WordPress Installer](https://github.com/makespaceweb/wordpress-installer), this child theme will automatically be added to your project.
* If using this theme manually, you will need to port over the `bower.json`, `gulpfile.js` and `package.json` files from the [Makespace WordPress Installer](https://github.com/makespaceweb/wordpress-installer) and change them to suit your project, and bring in the [Makespace Child Theme](https://github.com/makespaceweb/makespace-child)

## Issues/Problems/Optimizations
You should not edit this theme directly. Instead, if you see any changes, fixes, or optimizations that should be made, you should [open an issue on the theme](https://github.com/makespaceweb/makespace-framework/issues) so everyone can benefit.
